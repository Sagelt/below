This section covers _Below_ from the perspective of a player—someone controlling one or more characters questing for treasure to gain XP.

## Player Agenda

As a player your agenda is:

* **Challenge**. Your character's XP is your score, and you challenge yourself to reach as high a score as possible. As you play more you will develop skill as a player and better yourself. Each new character you play is a chance for a personal best. It is your responsibility to find opportunities to gain XP and pursue them.
* **Creativity**. Always seek the best solution to you goals. Your character is your tool for interacting with the fictional world and gaining XP from it—use their strengths and work around their weaknesses.
* **Cooperation**. Your other players are your team, and your best opportunity to pursue your goals is together.

## Player Tools

As a player, you have two primary tools at your disposal:

* Your reasoning, tactics, and strategy. You make the conscious decisions for your character, and your choices will in many cases be the biggest factor in your success or failure.
	* You will reason about the fantastic world the characters inhabit and use that to make choices that maximize benefit and limit risk. 
	* You will make tactical decisions for your character, choosing immedaite options to avoid danger or gain XP.
	* You will make strategic plans for your character, choosing between broad directions and goals according to how you reason about their benefits, risks, and your ability to face them.
* Your character's abilities, skills, gear, and knowledge. Your character implements your decisions, so your chosen course of action should always consider what your character is most suited for.
	* Your character's abilities measure how they may be more physically imposing, or slower, or better able to endure hardship than you are.
		* One reflection of your character's abilities is their stats, which reflect core capabilities of their body and mind. Each is rated from -3 to +3 with higher scores being better. The stats are:
			* Strength, measuring the ability to exert physical force.
			* Dexterity, measuring the ability to move quickly and precisely.
			* Constitution, measuring the ability to endure physical hardship, pain, and injury.
			* Intelligence, measuring the ability to spot patterns, reason about the world, and use the complex formulas of arcane magic.
			* Wisdom, measuring the ability to draw in important information from senses, be present in the moment, and interact with the divine nature of the world.
			* Charisma, measuring the ability to adjust interactions to meet others' expectations and present a comportment that fits the situation.
	* Your character's skills are things they know how to do that you don't. This could be anything from carpentry to calling on ancient magic powers.
		* Each skill is presented on its own printable sheet. If you have that skill you use that sheet. Otherwise you don't.
		* Each skill also has advanced skills that modify or extend it. These are not gained when you first gain the skill, but may be gained later. When an advanced skill is gained, mark it.
		* Skills are listed in the appendix.
	* Your character's gear (and more broadly, anything around them that they can make use of) are your raw materials. As raw materials they have many uses—a sword makes a decent lever, in a pinch.
		* Weapons increase the damage your character can do
		* Rations are the food and water you carry. 
	* Your character's knowledge are what any person living in the fictional world would know. As a baseline your character knows:
		* About the area they live in out to a few miles or a bit more away:
			* How to get around—paths, roads, and the like
			* What areas are dangerous, and in what ways
			* What is useful and edible
			* Where people can be found, generally
		* About the people who live nearby:
			* Their general personality and disposition
			* Their notable skills
			* What they may have more of than they need
			* What they may have less of than they need
		* About the larger world:
			* The flag and colors of the person or entity that claims the land you live on
			* Roughly how often the tax collector or recruiter comes around and what they force from you
			* The names of several other places people might live and their general description

**When you consult your character's knowledge** ask the GM what you'd like to know. The GM will tell you what your character would know, consulting their relevant knowledge.

## Characters

* Characters have:
	* A name
	* An optional nickname
	* 6 stats
	* One or more hit dice
		* Each hit die has an HP value indicating how much it adds to the characters HP total
		* Each hit die may be spent, meaning it has been used. Spent hit dice are recovered over time

### Creating A Character

Before you play _Below_ you need to create a character to play with. Creating your character is like picking a person from a phone book: you'll end up with a random person from the fictional world. What you can do with their abilities, skills, and knowledge is up to you.

Characters can be created in 5-10 minutes. The first session of a campaign begins with character creation together as a group. Whatever characters you create have decided to work together to pursue fortune beginning at a local location rumored to contain valuable treasures.

Your character is one chance to pursue as much XP as possible, but many characters will meet their end unexpectedly. Don't borrow future sorrow be investing heavily in your character. Follow the steps below and add any other details or connections to other characters that come to mind, but don't add more to your character than comes easily—they may not be around for long.

#### Character Creation Step By Step

Below - Character Creation Steps.md

### Multiple Characters

Players can opt to bring more than one character on an adventure, either as work-for-hire **hirelings** or by playing **multiple characters.**

#### Hirelings

Hirelings are hired workers who accompany player characters on adventures. Players can give them orders, but their exact actions are up to the GM to describe. They will typically face dangers, but not willingly sacrifice themselves or face certain death.

Hirelings expect pay of 1 gold per watch paid daily (3 gold total for a day's work). A positive reputation or a particularly motivating mission may give a discount of 1 gold per day, or allow for negotiating terms of payment other than daily.

#### Multiple Characters

Each player can play more than one character. Each character will get an equal share of XP, so choosing to bring more characters lessens the reward for each character, but otherwise the number of characters to bring is entirely up to the players.

## Gameplay

As a player you play _Below_ by stating your character’s actions, including what they say and do. 

### Stating Actions

### Intent

### Conditionals

### Risk & Reward

Remember your agenda as a player: seek XP. 

## XP

XP is awarded for treasure retrieved from dangerous locations. 

When player characters return from a dangerous location with treasure:

1. Sum the total value of treasure retrieved by all characters in gp. One XP is earned for each gp. 
2. Divide the XP total evenly among characters. Any remainder is split first to the lowest level characters. 

## Advancement

Your character, should they survive, will advance through **levels, skills, and gear.**

### Level Advancement

The most important advancement is your character's level, which indicates their raw potential. Characters start at level 1, and as they accumulate XP they gain potential and eventually advance in level.

A character's _current_ XP always indicates their level as listed below.

| XP | Level | Maximum Skills |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1000 | 2 | 1 |
| 2000 | 3 | 2 |
| 4000 | 4 | 2 |
| 8000 | 5 | 3 |

#### Gaining Levels

When a character's XP increases such that their level increases:

* They write their new level on their sheet.
* They may either:
	* Gain a new d6 hit die
	* Reroll all their existing hit dice and take only values which are higher than their previous roll

Characters do not _immediately_ gain skills when gaining levels. See _Skill Advancement._

#### Losing Levels

In the unusual circumstance where a character loses XP such that they go down a level:

* They write their new level on their sheet. If the new level is 0, they die.
* They lose a d6 hit die. If they do not have any, they die.
* If their number of skills exceeds their maximum at their new level, they choose a skill to loose. 

### Skill Advancement 

A character may have a number of skills equal to their level divided by two, rounded up, as listed on the level table.

If a character has fewer skills than their maximum they can gain a new skill by finding a suitable trainer and paying for training. 
* The GM will identify any trainers known to the players and what skills they can train. 
* The cost for training is based on the number of skills already known before the new skill is trained:

| Already Known Skills | Cost To Train New Skill |
|:--|:--|
| 0 | 100gp |
| 1 | 1,000gp |
| 2 | 10,000gp |
| 3 | 100,000gp |

Some skills, especially those involving magic, have additional requirements to learn. A character must meet those requirements in order to train that skill. 

#### Gear Advancement

Improved equipment may become available for plunder or purchase.  This is both the most common form of advancement and the least powerful in most cases.
