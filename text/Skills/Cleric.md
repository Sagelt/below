You can channel the will of the gods through a relic to cast divine spells. When you cast a divine spell through a relic, spend a hit die to roll+Wisdom. On a hit the spell takes effect. On a 7-9, choose one:

* The spell drains you: the GM chooses one of your stats to temporarily reduce by 1.
* The spell leaks additional energy: roll your largest hit die and take that much damage.
* The spell is limited: the GM will adjudicate how the spell's effect is reduced by half in potency, duration, or impact.

On a 6-, the GM will say how the casting or the spell goes wrong.

By default your deity will grant you Heal Wounds, Consecrate, and one spell related to their domain.

#### Divine Spells

##### Core Spells

###### Heal Wounds
Your touch mends flesh and knits bones. Touch a creature and roll your largest hit die or it's largest hit die, whichever is bigger: it regains that many hit points.

###### Consecrate
Mark an area no more than 10 square yards: it becomes marked by your deity for as long as the hit die used to cast this remains spent. Creatures may not enter the area without your permission. Creatures within the area recover an extra 1d4 HP whenever they gain HP.

##### Domain: The Hunt

###### Scent
Name a type of creature or a specific being. For as long as the hit die used to cast this spell remains spent your senses are attuned to that creatureâ€™s scent. You always know the direction and distance of the closest matching creature(s).
