**Requirements:** A spellbook containing at least one spell.

You know how to transform the written instructions for casting a spell into the magical application of that spell to create magical effects. When you cast a spell from a spellbook, spend a hit die to roll+Intelligence. On a hit the spell takes effect. On a 7-9, choose one:

* The spell drains you: the GM chooses one of your stats to temporarily reduce by 1.
* The spell leaks additional energy: roll your largest hit die and take that much damage.
* The spell is limited: the GM will adjudicate how the spell's effect is reduced by half in potency, duration, or impact.

On a 6-, the GM will say how the casting or spell goes wrong.
