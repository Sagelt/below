# Rules Guide

The rules of _Below_ structure the conversation between the players and the GM. The most basic rule is the **conversation**: who can say what about which topics. _Below_ can be played with only this basic structure and no other rules, but it is helpful to provide additional structure for **time, tools, and training.** How the players use those factors influences **uncertain actions, damage and healing.**

## The Conversation

## Time

Time in _Below_ is tracked in three units. Each unit is a rough approximation of a number of minutes or hours, but is not exact. Instead these units are used to help track things occurring over time.

### Action Turns

An action turns track moment-to-moment activities. Each action turn each character and NPC can do roughly one thing—attack someone else, climb a short ladder, run several meters. An action turn is around 15-45 seconds.

Action turns are typically only tracked in moments of action when multiple people or creatures may be acting at once at cross purposes.

At the end of each action turn:

* The GM checks morale for any creatures in combat
* The GM states what actions each creature is taking and allow the players to respond, starting a new action turn.

### Exploration Turns

An exploration turn tracks time spent moving through a dangerous area. Each exploration turn is enough time to move cautiously over short distance (around ten meters), carelessly over a long distance (twenty meters), search a small room, or have a pointed conversation. An exploration turn is around 10-15 minutes.

Exploration turns are tracked when the characters are in a hostile environment, and help measure how resources like torches will be consumed.

If you need to convert time measured in action turns to exploration turns, assume around 20 action turns per exploration turn.

At the end of each exploration turn:

* The GM updates any creature trackers in the area and describes any observable changes the characters might notice.

### Watch Turns

Watch turns track time spent recovering or engaging in labor. Each watch turn is enough time to recover from physical exertion, treat a wound, or undertake a small project of physical labor such as digging a portion of ditch. A watch turn is about 8 hours.

Watch turns are tracked when the speed of recovery or readiness for travel is important.

If you need to convert exploration turns to watch turns, assume around 32 exploration turns to a watch turn.

At the end of each watch turn:

* Each character may consume one ration of food and one ration of water.
	* If a character consumes food and water and they have a temporarily reduced stat they may increase that stat by 1 up to its normal value.
	* If a character does not consume food or water they temporarily reduce one stat by 1.
* Each character who spent the entire watch resting may either:
	* Spend one hit die to roll it and recover that much HP
	* Recover one spent hit die so that it can be spent again
* The GM updates any area trackers

### Town Turns

Town turns track time spent in relative safety with ready access to food, water, and others to speak and trade with. One town turn is long enough to recover from most injuries, prepare for a new excursion, or undertake a project. A town turn is 2-5 days.

At the end of each town turn:

* Each character who had suitable accommodations recovers all HP and resets all stats to their starting values.

## Tools

Width:50%

Tools are the useful things characters use to achieve their goals. Quite frequently these will be things the characters carry with them, but they may also be improvised from the environment.

### Slots

The amount characters can carry is measured in slots. Each character has 10 + str item slots. At most two slots of items can be in a characters' hands at any time, all others must be worn or packed.

Slots represent both bulk and weight, and assume a character has appropriate bags and straps to carry with. 

### Food & Water

Food & water are measured in rations. 

* A **ration of food** is a meal. Characters need three rations of food per day (one per watch).
* A **ration of water** is several ounces. Characters need three rations of water per day (one per watch).

When a watch passes in which a character does not consume both a ration of food and a ration of water they temporarily reduce a stat.

Typically one item slot can fit 6 food but only 3 water. This assumes hardtack and a water skin. More compact food is often available for a price, the most common being elven waybread (1 slot, 12 food). Water is much harder to compact, with only magical effects being able to condense more than 3 water into one slot.

Characters may be able to obtain more food or water from appropriate locations. Players may refill their water skins or harvest plants and meat as they see fit—the GM will tell them how much food and water they obtain. If the source of the food or water is covered by the character's knowledge the GM will tell the player any other effects of the food or water. Otherwise the GM will tell the players that they do not know what side effects the food or water may have. Carefully testing a new food or water source takes one watch for one character, who spends the time slowly introducing larger amounts of it and waiting for any reactions. At the end of the watch the GM will tell them any side effects.

### Light

Characters will quite frequently be in locations without natural light, forcing them to rely on their own illumination. Torches and lanterns are the most common light sources.

A torch takes one slot, and when burning it must be in a hand slot. Torches last 10 exploration turns.

A lantern takes one slot, and when burning it must be in a hand slot. Lanterns last one watch (32 exploration turns). A refill of oil takes one slot and can refill a lantern three times.

### Weapons & Armor

Characters may have to resort to combat, or may have it thrust upon them. Most will wish to have a weapon at hand.

* **Simple weapons** are clubs, slings, knives, daggers, and anything that can be used to bludgeon someone with. They do d4 damage and take one slot.
* **Standard weapons** are short swords, mauls, axes, and the like. They do d6 damage and take one slot.
* **Weapons of war** are carefully crafted arms like long swords, long bows, and flails. They do d8 damage and take one slot.

Weapons may also be ranged, thrown, or reach:

* **Long** weapons can hold off an attacker, keeping them out of reach or normal weapons. A long weapon takes two slots.
* **Thrown** weapons can be used to attack at a distance of 10-20 feet. Once thrown they must be recovered before they can be used again.
* **Ranged** weapons can be used to attack at a distance of 10-30 feet and takes two slots. Ammunition is 1 slot for 10 ammunition.

Armor reduces damage taken from weapons but not generally from falling, crushing, or the like:

* **Leather or similar** is flexible non-metallic stuff: 1 slot, 1 damage reduction.
* **Chain or similar** is flexible metallic stuff: 1 slot, 2 damage reduction.
* **Plate or similar** is stout metallic stuff: 2 slots, 3 damage reduction.

Shields are 1 slot, +1 damage reduction, are must be held.

### Other Tools

Other useful items such as hammers, crowbars, spikes, and rope are tracked individually. Most take up one slot.

### Common Prices

Prices may vary from location to location, but these are typical of small villages and steadings with ready connections to other settled areas.

## Training

A characters' **training** reflects the things the character knows, or knows how to do, which the player does not. These are reflected by the characters' **skills** and **knowledge.**

### Knowledge

width:50%

Knowledge are the broad fields of experience or learning a character may have, typically related to how they provide for themselves or some area of academic study. Each character starts with one area of knowledge and can gain more in play.

Each area of knowledge is a broad field which the character knows about. Having an area of knowledge means that the character has both conceptual grasp of that field and practical application of it. A character with knowledge in wayfinding can both describe how to orient themselves and find their way between two points with some basic information on them.

Areas of knowledge cover the ideas and practical application appropriate to someone who works regularly in that area, not every piece of expert knowledge and application. The limits of an area of knowledge are up to the GM to adjudicate.

A character who gains the same area of knowledge twice is an expert, one of the best of their field. 

### Skills

Skills represent things the character can do, from the mundane (moving through the shadows without being noticed) to the magical (working divine miracles).

Many skills modify the core rules of the game. A skill will commonly interact with one of the core rules:

* The conversation, by stating that the GM will provide a specific piece of information or answer a specific question
* Time, by stating that an action can be done more quickly, or that an effect happens at certain turns
* Uncertain actions, by modifying the possible outcomes or providing a different rule for a given situation which supplants the normal uncertain action rule.
* Damage and healing, by dealing or mitigating damage or changing how a character heals.

## Uncertain Actions

When a character does something with time, tools, and training they do it as well as could be hoped for in the situation. The GM describes the outcome.

When a character lacks in time, tools, or training the GM tells the player what stat the action depends on:

* Strength for physical force
* Dexterity for speed and agility
* Constitution for endurance
* Wisdom for mental clarity and focus
* Intelligence for quick thinking
* Charisma for persuasion

The player rolls 2d6 and adds that stat, or no stat if the GM judges that non applies. On a 10+ the action goes as well as could be hoped for, the GM will adjudicate how. On a 7-9 the action is complicated, the GM will describe an additional cost, complication, or tough choice to be made. On a 6- it goes badly, the GM will adjudicate how.

When a character lacks in time, tools, and training the task is impossible.

## Damage And Healing

When a character takes damage they subtract that amount from their current HP. 

Characters that reach 0 hp are dead. 

HP is recovered:

* At the end of a
