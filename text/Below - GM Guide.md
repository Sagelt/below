## GM Agenda

As a GM your agenda is:

* **Create** a fictional world with danger and opportunity. This creation may be whole-cloth, with the GM starting from scratch, or it may be an adaptation of an idea or published work from someone else—once the GM adapts it is is their creation and they are not beholden to the idea that inspired it anymore than they wish to be.
* **Adjudicate** the fictional world. The GM is the natural order, the way the fictional world's atoms (or whatever it's made of) interact and cause a tunnel to collapse or a sword to cut. The GM does not reward or punish, does not plot, and does not direct. When adjudicating the outcome of an action, the GM always asks what would follow from the world as established.
* **Facilitate** a game set in that fictional world. Keep the conversation by which the players interact with the world moving, and work with the other people at the table to engage together in a shared endeavor of playing _Below._

## GMing Tools

As the GM, to present the world you create you will rely on two primary tools: maps and turn trackers. A third tool, fronts, link the passage of turns tracked on the turn tracker to the current state of the map.

## Locations

The GM populates the world with locations containing opportunities for treasure, setting up an open-ended challenge for the players to extract that treasure and gain XP. 

A location can offer opportunities for treasure in multiple ways:

* Owned treasure is treasure present in the location which belongs to someone who wishes to keep it. 
* Forgotten treasure is treasure in a location that is not widely known to be there, and which is no longer protected or owned by a creature. 
* External treasure is treasure that is not physically present in the location, but which can be gained by interacting with the location, for example by returning something that is not itself valuable to someone who is willing to pay for it. 

There are three general categories of locations:

* Equilibrium locations are places that contain potential treasure which are not likely to substantially change without external influence. Lairs, forgotten temples, and the like. 
* Evolving locations are places that are materially changing over time, such that the potential value and situation in the location may be different depending on when the characters arrive. 

### Published Locations 

There are many excellent published locations (often called adventures) which can be used with _Below._

## Time

The world you create is a dynamic place, so you track the time that passes so you can manage how the world changes. To manage this process you will create **fronts** representing the important dynamic factors in a given area.

Fronts are classified by their **cadence** and **type.** A front's type can be either:

* **Clock** for fronts that track a developing situation which will reach an end state (and possibly shift into a new front). For example, the demon summoning ritual in the basement would be a clock front representing the progress towards the final summoning.
* **State** for fronts that track the normal behavior of a group or a single significant creature. For example, the bandits in the tower regularly go on raids, spend their ill-gotten gains, recuperate, or plot their next job.

Cadence indicates how often the front is updated:

* Action fronts update each action round, usually for something that is happening very quickly
* Exploration fronts update each exploration round, usually tracking patrols or environmental effects
* Watch fronts update each watch turn, usually for the daily activities of conscious creatures
* Town fronts update each town turn, usually tracking slowly developing events or activities of groups acting on a large scale, like armies.

Fronts are tracked on your turn tracker, grouped by what kind of turn they apply to. Leave notes on your locations which describe how they change based on the current state of a front.

Clock fronts are updated according to their cadence, and always progress forward along the stages of the front. Optionally a stage may be gated on a precondition (the ritual will not progress until the last cultist is freed) or may require a die roll (the ooze only breaks out of its container on a 5+ on a d6 roll).

Clock fronts are always tracked. Even if the characters are off somewhere else the ritual may be progressing.

State fronts describe for each state how to choose the next state at a time based on their cadence. That choice may be based on a die roll or a condition (for example, day or night). Each state front also indicates how to choose the starting state based on conditions or die rolls

State fronts are only tracked if they interact with areas the players are currently in or close by. If they players arrive at a location which might be affected by a state front that is not currently tracked, the front starts in its starting state as described by the front.

## Sessions

Play of _Below_ is divided into sessions.

### The First Session

## Campaigns 

## Non-Player Characters

Non-player characters do not have full stats like player characters. Instead they are measured directly in hit dice.

* An NPC's hit die size (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) indicates how powerful the creature is overall.
	* If the NPC is not specially trained or experienced it has 1 hit die
	* Specially trained: + 1 hit die
	* Experienced: +1 hit die
	* Magical: +1 hit die
	* Divine: +1 hit die
	* Ancient: +1 hit die
* An NPC's HP is equal to the total sides across all its hit dice. A d4 NPC has 4 HP, a 2d10 NPC has 20, etc.
	* If the NPC is especially hardy, add half that amount again
* An NPC has 1 damage reduction per hit die.
	* If the NPC is especially armored, add 1 damage reduction per hit die.
* An NPC can make one full attack per action round per hit die. This is typically only on a 6- result on a player's roll, or as a result of as surprise attack. It’s damage is equal to the hit die.
	* If the NPC is especially armed, add +2 to its damage.
* An NPC can make minor attacks as part of any 7-9 results. Minor attacks do damage equal to the creature’s number of hit dice.

### Converting NPCs

#### OSE

Instead of the listed hit die, use the largest attack damage die as the hit die and the number of attacks as the number of hit dice.
