# Concepts

* _Below_ is a game played by people.
	* The **GM** creates a fictional **world** and portrays most everyone and everything in it. They adjudicate the outcomes of actions within that world.
		* The GM plays to create a world, fairly and impartially judge actions in it, and facilitate the players interacting with that world.
	* The **players** each control one person within that fictional world, called a **character.**
		* The players play to gain as much XP for their characters as possible by extracting valuable things from dangerous locations or situations through creative thinking and team work.
	* Everyone (the players and GM) is responsible for creating a challenging, entertaining, and mutually fun experience.
* _Below_ is played via a **conversation** between the GM and players.
	* The players say what their characters say, think, and attempt.
	* The GM says how attempted actions work out, and how everything outside the players behavesâ€”from people to creatures to the turning of the seasons.
* The conversation in _Below_ invokes the **rules.**
	* Rules are ways of handling common situations or questions about how the world works.
	* Rules always require judgement. It is the job of the GM, with input from the players, to judge the rules fairly and consistently.
	* Rules focus on the aspects of the world that are obstacles to the characters gaining XP:
		* Rules for **time** lead to changes in the world and use up resources. The GM tracks abstract units of time which move events forward and track when characters need food, water, or rest.
		* Rules for **tools** describe how much a character can carry, including food and water, and how useful items impact their actions. The players track how much their character is carrying and may have to make decisions about what to leave behind.
		* Rules for **training** cover the abilities the characters posses which the players may not, from the mundane to the magical. 
		* Rules for **uncertain actions** govern how events play out when the result of an action is not clearly judgeable from the situation at hand. When an event is uncertain, the dice guide the outcome.
		* Rules for **damage and healing** cover suffering harm and recovering from it. 
* One continuous conversation of _Below_ is called a **session.**
	* A session is usually a continuous stream of fictional events taking 2-3 hours of GM and player time and describing one particular sequence of actions of the characters.
	* The sequence of actions taken by the players may be considerably longer than the amount of playing time, with minutes of play time spent on a long journey overland, or half an hour spent on an intricate maneuver through a trapped tunnel.
	* Not every sequence of events neatly fits into the available play time, so when the amount of available time is used up the players must rely on their characters to return to safety (if not already there) as described in the rules.
	* The first session begins with the characters at the entrance to a location which contains opportunities for XP, and follows their actions from there.
* Multiple sessions of _Below_ following the same characters become a **campaign.**
	* Each campaign follows characters over time, but the exact set of characters may shift as characters die and players join or leave. New characters can always be created so each player always has a character.
	* There are no pre-planned directions of series of events in a campaign. The campaign organically follows the characters as they pursue their goals.
	* There is no planned ending or climax to a campaign. The campaign continues until the players and GM decide they are done.
