_Below_ is a game of risky adventure in a fantastic world. The GM adjudicates the fantastic world, using reason, common sense, and rules to describe a place that does not truly exist and the outcomes of actions within it. The players create characters who exist within that fantastic world and attempt to gain as much XP as possible for them, using both the players' problem solving skills and the physical and mental abilities of the character.

As a GM, your goal is to present a fantastic, dynamic world and to adjudicate the outcomes of actions taken within that world. You are the laws of physics for an imagined place and the conscious thoughts of most everyone in it.

As a player, your goal is to make choices for your character in pursuit of XP. Your character is your presence within the fictional world presented by the GM. You are your character's conscious thoughts, making decision on what they do and how they react to the world around them. Your character is your body, subconscious thoughts, and the accumulated skill of someone living in this fantastic world. You decide what your character does, but the implementation of that action is through their body and situationâ€”their fear may cause them to stumble, or they may not be fast enough, or they may have a deeper knowledge than you do of how to break down a door.

Each game starts with a new set of characters, but the ending is up to you. Your character will likely, at some point, meet an end and their quest for XP will be over, but another character is always an option. Playing _Below_ is a bit like a sport: you can always pursue a higher score and a personal best.
