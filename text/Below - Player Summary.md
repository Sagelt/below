* When you have *tools, training, and time* your action is certain—it just happens. When you have none of tools, training, and time your action is impossible. When you have some but not all of tools, training, and time your action is uncertain, and will require a roll.
* **Tools** are things that help your character—kits, food, water, weapons, armor, etc.
	* Tools you carry use **slots** which represent how much your character can carry. Your character has 10+str item slots.
* **Training** is things your character knows how to do. Training is represented by *knowledge* and *skills*
	* **Knowledge** are broad fields that your character knows something about.
		* When you enter an area your knowledge may give you some information that would only normally be available when you *search.*
	* **Skills** are specific capabilities your character has which change the rules of the game.
* **Time** is how long your character spends on an activity. Time is tracked on different scales.
	* **Action turns** are used for quick series of short tasks, especially combat. 
		* An action turn is 15-45 seconds.
		* At the end of each action turn all enemies present act.
		* If you spend an action turn preparing an attack the attack is no longer an uncertain action—you just deal your damage.
	* **Exploration turns** are used when moving through a dangerous location, like a dungeon or enemy keep. 
		* An action turn is 10-15 minutes (about 20 action turns).
		* At the end of each action turn the GM will check for enemy movements and encounters.
		* When moving through an area in exploration turns the GM will tell you the *impression* of the space around you—what your senses and knowledge give you on a brief inspection.
		* If you spend an exploration turn to *search* a space the GM will also reveal the *detail* of the space, not just the impression.
		* A torch lasts 6 exploration turns. A vial of oil in a lantern lasts 12.
	* **Watch turns** are used to track progress through a day and overland travel.
		* A watch turn is 6 hours (24 exploration turns).
		* At the end of each watch turn you need food and water. If you can't or don't eat and drink you take -1 to all rolls (cumulative).
		* **Rest** watches involve staying in one place and recovering. When you take a rest watch roll and spend any unspent hit dice and gain that much HP. Then recover all spent hit dice.
		* If you go more than 3 watches between rests, for each additional watch you take -1 to all rolls (cumulative).
